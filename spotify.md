Main goal:
I guess I just want to see how much music I listen to each day and then display that on a graph over the course of one year 

# todo items 
- [ ] you've set up the firebase host. And you've created a dataset. Now you need to connect your git repo to the firebase folder directory that you created 
- [ ] Once you've done that, you need to figure out how to deploy the react app on the firebase host. (Front end side)
- [ ] set up the firestorage database by uploading your spotify data onto the website (you can import .json as collections) 
- [ ] move your calculations and report generation code onto a server where it can do it at anytime. This means to set up the server side calculations on firebase as well. 
- [ ] resize the .png file your uploading so that it's a better shape 
- [ ] clean up the .txt data your uploading so it actually looks visually nice... maybe this is where you incorporate javascript.
- [ ] set up a way for people to upload their data 
- [ ] set up a way for people to connect to the live data spotify api.
